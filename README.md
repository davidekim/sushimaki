## Description
This repo includes a script that generates helical or beta barrel WRAPs parametrically around a target protein to use as input for RF partial diffusion refinement.

## Reference
Ljubica MihaljeviÄ‡ et. al. Solubilization of Membrane Proteins using designed protein WRAPS. Submitted to Science.

## Installation
You can clone this repo into a preferred destination directory by going to that directory and then running:

`git clone https://github.com/davidekim/sushimaki.git`

### For complete pipeline to generate WRAPs
Install ppi_iterative_opt submodule for RF partial diffusion, ProteinMPNN, and Alphafold2 protein-protein interaction design optimization.

~~~
cd sushimaki
git submodule init
git submodule update
~~~

Complete ppi_iterative_opt installation by following instructions at https://github.com/davidekim/ppi_iterative_opt.


### Dependencies
PyRosetta https://www.pyrosetta.org

BBQ https://biocomp.chem.uw.edu.pl/tools/bbq

DeepTMHMM https://dtu.biolib.com/DeepTMHMM

Protein MPNN https://github.com/dauparas/ProteinMPNN

Alphafold2 https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphafold


## Usage
sushimaki.py is the main script that generates inputs for RF partial diffusion structure refinement and Protein MPNN sequence design to generate WRAPs.

For helical WRAPs
~~~
python ./sushimaki.py 2ge4A.pdb
~~~

For beta barrel WRAPs
~~~
python ./sushimaki.py --barrel 2ge4A.pdb
~~~

For RF partial diffusion backbone refinement, ProteinMPNN sequence design, and Alphafold2 validation
~~~
python ./ppi_iterative_opt/ppi_iterative_opt.py *_WRAP_*pdb
~~~
